without the android support v7 media or whatever lib
i tthink the regular api at our supported level wqill be sufficient
the

TvInputManager.TvInputCallback () {
    void onInputStateChanged(String inputId, int state) {
        state will be one of CONNECTED, CONNECTED_STANDBY, DISCONNECTED
    }
}

based on the ID, create or recall a button in the list displayed on the main activity screen
is there an adapter is makes sense to use?

->CONNECTED
change state to visible if GONE
make enabled
ensure click action initiates fullscreen disoplay of input


->CONNECTED_STANDBY
change state to visible if it was GONE
make disabled (click does nothing)

->DISCONNECTED
change visibility to GONE
disconnect click action and disabled state are supsrfluous


TvInputManager object is required i guess if we're making use of its exclusive callback


TvInputService - represents TV input/source such as HDMI pass-through
TvInputService.Session or .HardwareSession - base class to derive from

TvView & TvView.TvInputCallback
